	<h3>Data Science</h3>
	<p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/algorithm">algorithms</a> and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data,[1][2] and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.</p>

<p><img src="./data sc.png"style="float:left;"style="float: right;" width="20%"/>Data science is a "concept to unify statistics,<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/algorithm"> data analysis</a>, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">data science</a> is different from computer science and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">  information science</a>. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/algorithm"> data science </a>as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.</p>
<p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large (see big data), and applying the knowledge and actionable insights from data to solve problems in a wide range of application domains.[6] The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">statistics,</a> information science, mathematics, information visualization, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business.[7][8] Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/algorithm"> data science </a>to human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data.[9][10] In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.</p>
